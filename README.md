## Transparency about human-AI collaboration in live meetings

Here's what I'm learning about AI helping during collaborative meetings—not the polished version you see in demos, but the messy reality of working together during live sessions.

The emerging insight: AI seems to strengthen human collaboration when used transparently during live dialogue. Not to replace facilitators, but to catch patterns they might miss while staying present with the group.

This is a living collection of real prompts used in collaborative AI projects. Provisional, messy, alive. The goal is transparent learning about what actually works when humans and AI work together in high-stakes conversations.

## Context: transformation planning as example domain

These particular examples happen to come from transformation planning work since September 2024. Mental health care systems across the Netherlands are tasked with improving the system—complex work involving multiple stakeholders, competing priorities, and genuine care for vulnerable populations. Municipalities and local organizations are tasked with making this happen together.

High-stakes meetings where facilitators need every pattern they can catch while holding space for what emerges. Perfect testing ground for human-AI collaboration.

The prompts reveal universal patterns in human-AI collaboration that apply far beyond transformation work: any collaborative context where humans need to stay present while processing complex, multi-threaded information streams.

## What you'll find on this bench

Picture an actual workbench—tools that show wear marks, coffee rings on the plans, pencil marks tracking what worked last time. This is mine, but for AI-assisted collaboration.

Here's what's scattered across it:
- **Prompts we've actually used during high-stakes meetings** — not just theory, but tested in real collaboration sessions
- **Version iterations** — marked v4, v8, v9 because earlier attempts taught me something essential
- **What didn't work and why** — because failures teach more than successes
- **Universal collaboration challenges** with documented solutions that transfer across contexts

Everything here earned its place by working when it mattered, or by failing instructively.

## The human-AI collaboration pattern

The best human-AI collaboration feels like the room got smarter. Facilitators stay fully present—reading faces, holding emotions, guiding process. Meanwhile, Dembrane quietly captures what's happening across multiple conversations—letting us ask questions later about patterns we might have missed.

The sessions follow designed processes created by process facilitators. Most prompts run at predetermined points in the facilitation design. For echo interventions specifically (found in the Universal folder), facilitators make real-time decisions about timing—during breaks, between exercises, when patterns emerge.

This isn't scheduled automation, but it's not ad-hoc either. It's designed collaboration processes that include strategic AI pattern recognition. The AI becomes background support for human insight.

## What's in the examples

### Real collaboration tools with broad applicability
- **Echo interventions** for breaking circular discussions in any group setting
- **Pattern recognition** that works whether you're planning transformation, strategy, or community initiatives  
- **Multi-conversation synthesis** for processing complex stakeholder input
- **Implementation planning** that scales from transformation work to organizational change

### [`/examples/transformatieplan_traject_1/`](examples/transformatieplan_traject_1/) and [`/examples/transformatieplan_traject_2/`](examples/transformatieplan_traject_2/)
Transformation planning sessions with multiple organizations.

**From Trajectory 1, the first experiments:**
- **[Vision Feedback](examples/transformatieplan_traject_1/sessie_1/visie_terugkoppeling/README.md)** - 45 minutes of abstract conversation becomes validation-ready document in 30 seconds. Group: "Yes, that captures exactly what we meant."
- **[Echo Question](examples/transformatieplan_traject_1/sessie_1/vraag_voor_volgende_groep/README.md)** - The "echo button." 10 seconds to build bridges between rotating groups. From lost momentum to sharp connection.
- **[Theme Synthesis](examples/transformatieplan_traject_1/sessie_1/synthese_per_thema/README.md)** - From valuable session input to structured concept document. Normally: 1 day puzzling at home. Now: 1 minute processing, straight to the writing team.

**From Trajectory 2, the refinements:**
[KPI generators](examples/transformatieplan_traject_2/sessie_2/fac_werkblad_kpi.md) that help any group move from metrics anxiety to useful dialogue. [Echo interventions](examples/transformatieplan_traject_2/sessie_2/fac_dynamische_echo.md) for breaking circular discussions. You'll see multiple versions of the same prompt—because these tools get better through actual use, not perfect planning.

### [`/docs/tools/dembrane.md`](docs/tools/dembrane.md)
Background on how our transcription setup works—useful if you want to adapt these ideas for other meeting tools.

### [`/examples/universal_for_dembrane/`](examples/universal_for_dembrane/)
Prompts designed for any collaborative context. Includes [echo interventions](examples/universal_for_dembrane/echo_collective_voice.md) where facilitators make real-time timing decisions based on group dynamics.

### Version history reveals learning patterns
Multiple versions of the same prompt reflect how collaboration tools evolve. Annotations capture what worked, what didn't, and why human timing judgment matters more than perfect prompts.

## What I'm learning (and curious about)

Here's what seems to be emerging:

**AI helps during meetings, not after.** Real-time pattern recognition while conversations are happening keeps energy alive and insights relevant.

**Keep different groups separate, then compare.** When you can track breakout groups individually, you see patterns across groups—what's shared, what's unique, where the energy is.

**Your facilitation stays human.** AI catches patterns while you read faces, hold emotions, and guide process. You stay present with people; AI handles the data.

**Take what works, adapt everything.** Some of these prompts will work with ChatGPT or Notion AI. Others need conversation-aware tools. But the principles—timing, simplicity, human judgment—transfer everywhere.

I'm curious how you'll use this. What will you adapt? What works in your context? I'd love to hear how you experiment with these patterns.

## Concrete example: from 1 day to 1 minute

The first experiment took place in April 2025. A transformation planning session with 25 people, three tables, conversations about five-year visions. The facilitator had her phone on the table running Dembrane—transparent, everyone could see it.

After 45 minutes of vision conversation: 30 seconds of processing, a structured document on the screen. "Does this capture what you meant?" Nodding heads around the table.

Groups rotated tables. 10 seconds, a bridge question for the next group: "Group 1 discussed the vision for exploratory conversations and highlighted three important challenges with current intake procedures. What would be the most important next step to address these challenges while keeping the focus on genuine dialogue with citizens?"

End of the day: all conversations synthesized into a coherent concept document in one minute. Normally: a day puzzling at home with sticky notes. Now: straight to the writing team, ready for feedback.

[The complete story of this first experiment](examples/transformatieplan_traject_1/sessie_1/README.md) shows how transparent AI collaboration creates trust rather than distance.

## What works across contexts

Simple interventions outperform complex ones. The prompts that make space rather than fill it.

Here's what I'm noticing: timing matters more than perfect prompts. AI seems to catch what's already bubbling up in conversations, then offer it back when you sense the moment's right.

When groups notice AI picking up on subtext they missed, something shifts in how they think about the partnership.

These are field notes, not frameworks. Learning as I go.

## Why share this workbench

I basically opened up my actual working folder and scrubbed out the client names. No certification to chase, no methodology to master. Working with people who want AI to amplify human collaborative skills—catching patterns while they hold space, generating possibilities while they guide process.

These patterns won't all work in your context. Take what serves, adapt everything, leave what doesn't fit. Collaborative work matters too much to figure out alone.

This collection grows as we work with more organizations, with plans to add examples over time from different collaborative contexts as the approach develops.

## Getting started

Four steps that work for any collaborative context:

1. **Start with stories** - For beginners: begin with [the session_1 stories](examples/transformatieplan_traject_1/sessie_1/README.md) to see how it feels. For vision validation: try [vision feedback](examples/transformatieplan_traject_1/sessie_1/visie_terugkoppeling/README.md). Then choose one pattern from `/examples/` that matches a collaboration challenge you're facing.
2. **Read the version notes** (if there are any) first—failures teach more than successes about collaboration dynamics
3. **Try an intervention** when you determine it's appropriate in your next group session
4. **Share what you learn**—GitHub issue, email, conversation, however works

The future isn't human or AI. It's human with AI, each doing what they do well, creating collaborative possibilities neither could manage alone.

This workbench evolves as collaborative practice develops. Living tools for living work.

## Transparency about this project itself

This repository is created in collaboration with Claude, an AI assistant. As a one-person team trying to share as much as possible about how valuable AI collaboration can be, this also means there might be mistakes.

See something that's not right? Have improvements? Please let me know—that helps make this project better and shows that human-AI collaboration works best with human feedback and corrections.
