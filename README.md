# Social AI Workbench

*[Nederlandse versie: [LEES_MIJ.md](LEES_MIJ.md)]*

## From day-long processing to 1-minute synthesis

Picture this: 20-30 stakeholders from municipalities and care organizations sitting around tables covered with sticky notes. The facilitator is collecting discussion points, making sure everyone's voice gets heard. Standard process.

Then comes the part everyone knows but rarely talks about: after the session, the project team disappears for a full day to process all those sticky notes and scattered thoughts into something resembling a coherent concept document. That document goes to a 10-person writing team for feedback. Changes get made. The cycle repeats.

I was listening to a project leader describe exactly this process when it hit me: "What if AI could create that concept document directly from the conversation?"

Her response: "I'd like to try that once."

**The result: 1 minute instead of 1 day processing.**

The facilitator put her phone on the table for Dembrane transcription—nothing disruptive, just there. During natural session breaks (bathroom, coffee), we processed the transcript in real-time. The AI output got copied to a Google Doc and shown on screen via beamer.

The stakeholders saw their own language reflected back immediately. Not some sanitized version written by people who weren't in the room, but their actual words and phrases organized into something coherent. The recognizability was everything—these people needed to implement the plan, so they needed to see themselves in it.

[The complete story of this first experiment](examples/transformatieplan_traject_1/sessie_1/README.md) shows exactly how this worked.

## What this workbench is

This is a living collection of real prompts that help AI catch patterns while facilitators stay present with the group. Not the polished version you see in demos, but the messy reality of working together during live sessions.

Picture an actual workbench—tools that show wear marks, coffee rings on the plans, pencil marks tracking what worked last time. This is mine, but for AI-assisted collaboration.

The breakthrough insight: **Timing beats sophistication.** The AI output didn't need to be perfect—it needed to be timely and recognizable. When stakeholders saw their own language organized into coherent form within minutes of speaking it, something shifted. Instead of feeling replaced by technology, they felt heard by it.

## What's scattered across it

- **Prompts we've actually used during high-stakes meetings** — not just theory, but tested in real collaboration sessions
- **Version iterations** — marked v4, v8, v9 because earlier attempts taught me something essential
- **What didn't work and why** — because failures teach more than successes
- **Universal collaboration challenges** with documented solutions that transfer across contexts

Everything here earned its place by working when it mattered, or by failing instructively.

## The human-AI collaboration pattern

The best human-AI collaboration feels like the room got smarter. Facilitators stay fully present—reading faces, holding emotions, guiding process. Meanwhile, Dembrane quietly captures what's happening across multiple conversations—letting us ask questions later about patterns we might have missed.

This isn't scheduled automation, but it's not ad-hoc either. It's designed collaboration processes that include strategic AI pattern recognition. The AI becomes background support for human insight.

## What's in the examples

### Real collaboration tools with broad applicability
- **Echo interventions** for breaking circular discussions in any group setting
- **Pattern recognition** that works whether you're planning transformation, strategy, or community initiatives  
- **Multi-conversation synthesis** for processing complex stakeholder input
- **Implementation planning** that scales from transformation work to organizational change

### [`/examples/transformatieplan_traject_1/`](examples/transformatieplan_traject_1/) and [`/examples/transformatieplan_traject_2/`](examples/transformatieplan_traject_2/)
Transformation planning sessions with multiple organizations.

**From Trajectory 1, the first experiments:**
- **[Vision Feedback](examples/transformatieplan_traject_1/sessie_1/visie_terugkoppeling/README.md)** - 45 minutes of abstract conversation becomes validation-ready document in 30 seconds. Group: "Yes, that captures exactly what we meant."
- **[Echo Question](examples/transformatieplan_traject_1/sessie_1/vraag_voor_volgende_groep/README.md)** - The "echo button." 10 seconds to build bridges between rotating groups. From lost momentum to sharp connection.
- **[Theme Synthesis](examples/transformatieplan_traject_1/sessie_1/synthese_per_thema/README.md)** - From valuable session input to structured concept document. Normally: 1 day puzzling at home. Now: 1 minute processing, straight to the writing team.

**From Trajectory 2, the refinements:**
[KPI generators](examples/transformatieplan_traject_2/sessie_2/fac_werkblad_kpi.md) that help any group move from metrics anxiety to useful dialogue. [Echo interventions](examples/transformatieplan_traject_2/sessie_2/fac_dynamische_echo.md) for breaking circular discussions. You'll see multiple versions of the same prompt—because these tools get better through actual use, not perfect planning.

### [`/docs/tools/dembrane.md`](docs/tools/dembrane.md)
Background on how our transcription setup works—useful if you want to adapt these ideas for other meeting tools.

### [`/examples/universal_for_dembrane/`](examples/universal_for_dembrane/)
Prompts designed for any collaborative context. Includes [echo interventions](examples/universal_for_dembrane/echo_collective_voice.md) where facilitators make real-time timing decisions based on group dynamics.

### Version history reveals learning patterns
Multiple versions of the same prompt reflect how collaboration tools evolve. Annotations capture what worked, what didn't, and why human timing judgment matters more than perfect prompts.

## Context: transformation planning as example domain

These particular examples happen to come from transformation planning work since September 2024. Mental health care systems across the Netherlands are tasked with improving the system—complex work involving multiple stakeholders, competing priorities, and genuine care for vulnerable populations. Municipalities and local organizations are tasked with making this happen together.

High-stakes meetings where facilitators need every pattern they can catch while holding space for what emerges. Perfect testing ground for human-AI collaboration.

The prompts reveal universal patterns in human-AI collaboration that apply far beyond transformation work: any collaborative context where humans need to stay present while processing complex, multi-threaded information streams.

## What I'm learning (and curious about)

Here's what seems to be emerging:

**AI helps during meetings, not after.** Real-time pattern recognition while conversations are happening keeps energy alive and insights relevant.

**Keep different groups separate, then compare.** When you can track breakout groups individually, you see patterns across groups—what's shared, what's unique, where the energy is.

**Your facilitation stays human.** AI catches patterns while you read faces, hold emotions, and guide process. You stay present with people; AI handles the data.

**Take what works, adapt everything.** Some of these prompts will work with ChatGPT or Notion AI. Others need conversation-aware tools. But the principles—timing, simplicity, human judgment—transfer everywhere.

I'm curious how you'll use this. What will you adapt? What works in your context? I'd love to hear how you experiment with these patterns.

## What works across contexts

Simple interventions outperform complex ones. The prompts that make space rather than fill it.

Here's what I'm noticing: timing matters more than perfect prompts. AI seems to catch what's already bubbling up in conversations, then offer it back when you sense the moment's right.

When groups notice AI picking up on subtext they missed, something shifts in how they think about the partnership.

These are field notes, not frameworks. Learning as I go.

## Why share this workbench

I basically opened up my actual working folder and scrubbed out the client names. No certification to chase, no methodology to master. Working with people who want AI to amplify human collaborative skills—catching patterns while they hold space, generating possibilities while they guide process.

These patterns won't all work in your context. Take what serves, adapt everything, leave what doesn't fit. Collaborative work matters too much to figure out alone.

This collection grows as we work with more organizations, with plans to add examples over time from different collaborative contexts as the approach develops.

## Getting started

Four steps that work for any collaborative context:

1. **Start with stories** - For beginners: begin with [the session_1 stories](examples/transformatieplan_traject_1/sessie_1/README.md) to see how it feels. For vision validation: try [vision feedback](examples/transformatieplan_traject_1/sessie_1/visie_terugkoppeling/README.md). Then choose one pattern from `/examples/` that matches a collaboration challenge you're facing.
2. **Read the version notes** (if there are any) first—failures teach more than successes about collaboration dynamics
3. **Try an intervention** when you determine it's appropriate in your next group session
4. **Share what you learn**—GitHub issue, email, conversation, however works

The future isn't human or AI. It's human with AI, each doing what they do well, creating collaborative possibilities neither could manage alone.

This workbench evolves as collaborative practice develops. Living tools for living work.

## Transparency about this project itself

This repository is created in collaboration with Claude, an AI assistant. As a one-person team trying to share as much as possible about how valuable AI collaboration can be, this also means there might be mistakes.

See something that's not right? Have improvements? Please let me know—that helps make this project better and shows that human-AI collaboration works best with human feedback and corrections.
