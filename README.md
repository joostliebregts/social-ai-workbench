# Social AI Workbench

A living collection of real prompts used in collaborative AI projects. This is a **workshop bench** — messy, alive, and provisional.

## Why Share

Transparency about how we actually work with AI strengthens co-creative human processes. These are the real prompts behind projects like the Doesburg pilot and Social GitHub, shared to show how AI collaboration can lead to clearer listening and faster alignment.

## What's Here Today

- `/examples/` — Raw prompts from real projects
- No categorization or metadata yet — this is ship-day mode

The prompts are unpolished and context-dependent. They're artifacts of specific moments in collaborative processes, not universal templates.

## What's Next

Future improvements will be tracked as GitHub Issues labeled "Task":
- Add metadata templates for better prompt documentation  
- Organize examples by project or technique
- Create contribution guidelines

## Contribute

PRs welcome for additional examples or organizational improvements. No promises about long-term maintenance — this is a workbench, not a product.
