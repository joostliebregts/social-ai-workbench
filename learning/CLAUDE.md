# CLAUDE.md - Learning Directory

## Purpose

This directory is planned to contain public learning materials derived from the Social AI Workbench. Unlike `/examples/` which contains raw working prompts, this directory will house distilled insights, patterns, and educational materials for the broader community.

## Current Status: Ship-Day Mode

As of now, this directory structure exists but is not yet fully populated due to ship-day constraints. The focus has been on collecting and sharing real prompts first, with systematic learning extraction planned as a future enhancement.

## Planned Structure

```
learning/
├── iterations/          # Prompt evolution documentation
├── lessons-learned/     # Distilled patterns and insights
└── prompt-ratings/      # Assessment frameworks and effectiveness metrics
```

## Future Vision

### What Will Be Here
- **Prompt evolution stories**: How specific prompts developed through real use
- **Pattern libraries**: Common structures that work across different contexts  
- **Assessment frameworks**: Methods for evaluating prompt effectiveness
- **Workshop methodologies**: Reusable facilitation patterns
- **Effectiveness metrics**: What works, what doesn't, and why

### What Won't Be Here
- Raw, unprocessed prompts (those go in `/examples/`)
- Private client transcripts (those go in `/context/conversations/`)
- Theoretical frameworks without real-world validation
- Polished academic papers (maintaining the workbench aesthetic)

## Learning Extraction Process (Planned)

### From Examples to Learning
1. **Pattern identification**: Recognize recurring structures in `/examples/`
2. **Effectiveness tracking**: Note which prompts work well in live sessions
3. **Abstraction**: Extract general principles while preserving practical context
4. **Documentation**: Create accessible learning materials

### Community Contribution
- **Open for PRs**: Additional patterns and insights welcome
- **Real-world grounding**: Contributions should be based on actual usage
- **Workbench aesthetic**: Keep practical and direct, not academic
- **Transparency**: Document sources and limitations of insights

## Quality Standards

When this directory is populated, materials will follow these principles:

### Evidence-Based Learning
- All insights grounded in actual prompt usage
- Clear documentation of context and constraints
- Honest assessment of what worked and what didn't
- Transparent about limitations and edge cases

### Accessible Documentation
- Written for practitioners, not researchers
- Include concrete examples alongside abstract principles
- Maintain bilingual accessibility (Dutch/English)
- Use the same direct style as the main project

## For AI Assistants

When this directory becomes active:

### Working with Learning Materials
1. **Build on real examples**: Always start with actual prompts from `/examples/`
2. **Maintain practitioner focus**: Write for people doing live facilitation
3. **Document evolution**: Show how prompts changed through real use
4. **Preserve context**: Don't abstract away the messiness of real collaboration

### Contributing Insights
- **Pattern recognition**: Identify what works across different prompts
- **Effectiveness analysis**: Document why certain approaches succeed
- **Failure analysis**: Learn from prompts that didn't work as expected
- **Iterative refinement**: Show how prompts improve through use

## Integration with Main Project

This learning directory connects to:
- **`/examples/`**: Source material for pattern extraction
- **`/context/conversations/`**: Private transcripts that inform effectiveness assessment
- **Main CLAUDE.md**: Overall project methodology and constraints
- **GitHub Issues**: Tracking learning extraction as "Task" labeled issues

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

Even when populated, this directory will avoid:
- Theoretical frameworks without practical grounding
- Over-engineered categorization systems
- Academic tone that alienates practitioners
- Premature abstraction that loses practical value
- Feature creep beyond the core learning mission

## Long-Term Vision

Eventually, this directory should become a valuable resource for:
- **Facilitators** learning to integrate AI into live sessions
- **Prompt engineers** understanding real-world collaborative contexts
- **Workshop designers** adapting patterns to their specific needs
- **AI researchers** studying human-AI collaboration in practice

The goal is to democratize the knowledge of how AI can enhance human collaboration, while maintaining the practical, direct approach that makes this workbench valuable.
