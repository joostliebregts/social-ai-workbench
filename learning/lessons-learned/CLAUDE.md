# CLAUDE.md - Lessons Learned Directory

## Purpose

This subdirectory is planned to house distilled patterns and insights extracted from real prompt usage in the Social AI Workbench. Unlike `/examples/` (raw prompts) or `/iterations/` (evolution stories), this directory focuses on actionable patterns that can guide future prompt development.

## Current Status

Currently contains a `PATTERNS.md` file with the beginnings of pattern documentation. In ship-day mode, the focus has been on collecting examples first, with systematic pattern extraction planned as the project matures.

## What Will Be Here

### Distilled Design Patterns
- **Echo Interventions**: Single powerful questions for live facilitation
- **Implementation Generators**: Multi-step plans with transparency blocks
- **Synthesis Tools**: Thematic clustering across conversations  
- **Feedback Processors**: Revision with reasoning documentation

### Cross-Cutting Insights
- **Language handling**: Bilingual context management patterns
- **Live facilitation**: Real-time application constraints and opportunities
- **Dembrane integration**: Working effectively with multi-conversation structures
- **Transparency principles**: Source attribution and limitation documentation

### Failure Patterns
- **What doesn't work**: Common prompt failure modes
- **Context dependencies**: When patterns break down
- **Edge cases**: Unusual situations that require special handling
- **Recovery strategies**: How to adapt when things go wrong

## Documentation Approach

### Pattern Structure
Each insight document should include:
- **Context**: Where and when this pattern applies
- **Description**: What the pattern is and how it works
- **Examples**: Concrete instances from `/examples/`
- **Variations**: How the pattern adapts to different contexts
- **Anti-patterns**: What to avoid when applying this pattern
- **Source evidence**: Which prompts and sessions informed this insight

### Quality Standards
- **Evidence-based**: All patterns grounded in actual prompt usage
- **Practical focus**: Written for practitioners building new prompts
- **Honest assessment**: Include limitations and failure modes
- **Transferable insights**: Abstract enough to apply beyond original context

## Connection to Project Architecture

### Input Sources
- **Raw prompts** from `/examples/` provide evidence for patterns
- **Evolution stories** from `/iterations/` show how patterns develop
- **Assessment data** from `/prompt-ratings/` validates pattern effectiveness
- **Private transcripts** from `/context/conversations/` inform real-world performance

### Output Applications
- **New prompt development**: Patterns guide creation of new tools
- **Training materials**: Help facilitators understand design principles
- **Community learning**: Share insights with broader AI+facilitation community
- **Quality assurance**: Patterns become checklists for prompt review

## Expected Pattern Categories

### Structural Patterns
- **Multi-conversation handling**: Working with Dembrane's XML structure
- **Output formatting**: Effective structures for live facilitation
- **Source attribution**: Clear transparency practices
- **Language consistency**: Bilingual output management

### Facilitation Patterns  
- **Real-time constraints**: Designing for live session use
- **Group interaction**: Prompts that enhance rather than replace human dialogue
- **Iterative refinement**: Designing for rapid feedback cycles
- **Context preservation**: Maintaining session continuity

### Quality Patterns
- **No fabrication**: Ensuring outputs stay grounded in transcript content
- **Uncertainty handling**: Managing unknowns and incomplete information
- **Bias awareness**: Recognizing and mitigating prompt bias
- **Cultural sensitivity**: Adapting to different organizational contexts

## For AI Assistants

When working with lessons-learned materials:

### Creating New Patterns
1. **Start with evidence**: Always ground patterns in actual prompt usage
2. **Show variations**: Include different contexts where patterns apply
3. **Document limitations**: Be clear about when patterns don't work
4. **Provide examples**: Reference specific prompts from `/examples/`

### Applying Existing Patterns
- **Understand context**: Check if your situation matches pattern assumptions
- **Adapt thoughtfully**: Don't blindly copy patterns without understanding
- **Document adaptations**: Note how you modified patterns for your context
- **Feed back learnings**: Update patterns based on new usage experience

## Integration with Live Practice

### Feedback Loops
- **Session feedback**: Facilitators report what worked/didn't work
- **Participant responses**: Group reactions inform pattern effectiveness
- **Technical performance**: Speed, accuracy, and usability metrics
- **Iterative refinement**: Patterns evolve based on continued usage

### Training Integration
- **Facilitator onboarding**: Patterns become training materials
- **Prompt review**: Patterns provide quality checklists
- **New project setup**: Patterns guide initial prompt selection
- **Troubleshooting**: Patterns help diagnose and fix prompt issues

## Anti-Patterns for This Directory

Avoid:
- **Theoretical patterns**: Not grounded in actual usage
- **Over-generalization**: Abstracting away practical context
- **Academic tone**: Writing for researchers instead of practitioners  
- **Perfect case scenarios**: Ignoring messy realities of live facilitation
- **Static documentation**: Patterns that don't evolve with new evidence

## Long-Term Vision

This directory should eventually become:
- **A practical guide** for anyone designing prompts for collaborative AI
- **A quality assurance resource** for reviewing prompt effectiveness
- **A training curriculum** for facilitators learning AI integration
- **A research contribution** to understanding human-AI collaboration patterns

The goal is actionable wisdom that helps people build better prompts for real collaborative contexts, maintaining the workbench's practical and direct approach.
