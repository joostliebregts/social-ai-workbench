# Prompt Design Patterns That Work

*Distilled insights from real prompt iterations and usage.*

## Context-Rich Prompts vs Generic Templates

**What works:**
- Specific role definitions ("strategisch redacteur voor dit transformatieplan")  
- Project-specific terminology and references
- Clear constraints from the actual context

**What doesn't:**
- Generic "you are a helpful assistant" openings
- One-size-fits-all templates
- Ignoring the specific conversation dynamics

**Lesson:** Invest time in context-setting. Generic prompts produce generic outputs.

## Live Facilitation Constraints

**What works:**
- Prompts that produce 3-7 bullet points max for slides
- Clear structure that's easy to read aloud
- Built-in transparency about sources

**What doesn't:**  
- Long narrative outputs during meetings
- Complex nested structures that are hard to scan
- Outputs that require extensive interpretation

**Lesson:** Design for the facilitation moment, not just the content quality.

## Iteration-Friendly Architecture  

**What works:**
- Prompts with clear "instructions" sections that can be modified
- Explicit output formatting that stays consistent
- Built-in feedback incorporation mechanisms

**What doesn't:**
- Monolithic prompt blocks that are hard to modify  
- Implicit assumptions buried in the text
- Prompts that break when you change one element

**Lesson:** Structure prompts for maintainability from the start.

## Multi-Conversation Handling

**What works:**
- Per-conversation analysis followed by synthesis
- Explicit citation of source conversations  
- Clear differentiation between individual and collective insights

**What doesn't:**
- Trying to analyze everything at once without structure
- Losing track of which insights came from where
- Flattening all conversations into generic patterns

**Lesson:** Design for Dembrane's multi-conversation structure from the beginning.
