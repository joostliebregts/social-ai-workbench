# Learning Materials

This directory contains the **publicly shareable** meta-learning from prompt development. These materials show how prompts evolve, what works in practice, and how to assess effectiveness.

## Directory Structure

### `/iterations/`
Documentation of how specific prompts evolved through real usage:
- Version histories with rationale for changes
- Before/after comparisons  
- Context about what triggered each iteration

### `/lessons-learned/`
Distilled patterns and insights from prompt development:
- What works well in different contexts
- Common failure modes and how to avoid them
- Best practices for specific use cases

### `/prompt-ratings/`
Assessment frameworks and evaluations:
- Scoring criteria for prompt effectiveness
- Comparative analysis of different approaches
- Performance metrics and feedback integration

## How to Use These Materials

1. **Before creating new prompts**: Check lessons-learned for relevant patterns
2. **When iterating**: Document your changes in iterations/ 
3. **After testing**: Rate effectiveness and add insights to appropriate sections

## Privacy Note

Raw conversation transcripts are kept in `/context/conversations/` (git-ignored). Only the learning insights and iteration patterns are shared publicly here.

## Contributing

When adding learning materials:
- Remove any client-specific details
- Focus on the **why** behind changes, not just the what
- Include enough context for others to apply the insights
