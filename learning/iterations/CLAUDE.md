# CLAUDE.md - Iterations Directory

## Purpose

This subdirectory is planned to document prompt evolution â€” how specific prompts developed and improved through real-world usage in live facilitation sessions. This is where the story of prompt refinement gets captured.

## Current Status

Currently contains only a `TEMPLATE.md` file. In ship-day mode, the focus has been on collecting working prompts rather than documenting their evolution. This directory awaits real iteration stories from ongoing projects.

## What Will Be Here

### Prompt Evolution Stories
- **Version histories**: How prompts changed through actual use
- **Context for changes**: Why modifications were needed
- **Performance comparisons**: What worked better and why
- **Live session learnings**: How real facilitators adapted prompts

### Documentation Format
Following the template structure:
- **Original context**: Where and why the prompt was first created
- **Initial version**: The starting prompt
- **Iteration cycles**: Each change with reasoning
- **Current status**: Latest working version
- **Lessons learned**: What the evolution teaches us

## Types of Iterations Expected

### Performance-Driven Changes
- Prompts that were too slow for live sessions
- Output formats that didn't work well with groups
- Language that was too academic or too casual
- Instructions that were unclear to AI assistants

### Context-Driven Adaptations  
- Prompts adapted for different group sizes
- Modifications for specific facilitation styles
- Adjustments for multilingual contexts
- Changes for different organizational cultures

### Technical Improvements
- Better handling of Dembrane conversation structures
- More robust error handling for incomplete transcripts
- Improved source attribution and transparency
- Better integration with live facilitation workflows

## Documentation Principles

### Evidence-Based Iteration
- Document actual usage context, not theoretical improvements
- Include feedback from real facilitators and participants
- Show specific examples of before/after outputs
- Be honest about what didn't work and why

### Practitioner-Focused Learning
- Write for facilitators who will use these prompts
- Explain the "why" behind changes, not just the "what"  
- Include practical tips for applying lessons to other contexts
- Maintain the workbench aesthetic - direct and unpolished

## Connection to Main Project

### Source Material
- Iterations start with prompts from `/examples/`
- Real usage context comes from `/context/conversations/` (private)
- Changes are driven by actual facilitation experiences

### Learning Extraction
- Patterns identified here feed into `/learning/lessons-learned/`
- Assessment insights connect to `/learning/prompt-ratings/`
- Successful iterations may become new examples in `/examples/`

## For AI Assistants

When this directory becomes active:

### Working with Iteration Documentation
1. **Focus on real changes**: Document actual modifications made during real projects
2. **Capture context**: Always explain why changes were needed
3. **Show impact**: Document how changes affected prompt performance
4. **Preserve failure stories**: Include iterations that didn't work out

### Creating Iteration Stories
- **Start with a specific prompt** from `/examples/`
- **Document the original context** where it was first used
- **Track each modification** with clear reasoning
- **Include facilitator feedback** and participant responses
- **Show current status** and future development needs

## Quality Standards

### Real-World Grounding
- All iterations must be based on actual usage
- Include specific context about facilitation sessions
- Document feedback from real users (facilitators and participants)
- Show concrete examples of input/output changes

### Learning Value  
- Extract transferable insights from specific iterations
- Explain what the evolution teaches about prompt design
- Connect individual stories to broader patterns
- Maintain transparency about limitations and context

## Future Integration

This directory will eventually support:
- **Prompt engineering education**: Teaching through real examples
- **Facilitation training**: Showing how AI tools evolve in practice
- **Research insights**: Contributing to understanding of human-AI collaboration
- **Community learning**: Sharing what works across different contexts

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Theoretical iterations**: Changes not tested in real contexts
- **Over-documentation**: Capturing every tiny tweak instead of meaningful evolution
- **Sanitized stories**: Hiding failures or presenting perfect progression
- **Academic tone**: Writing for researchers instead of practitioners

The goal is honest documentation of how prompts actually evolve through real use, providing valuable insights for anyone working at the intersection of AI and human collaboration.
