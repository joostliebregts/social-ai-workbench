# From Vision Talk to Vision Document

*When 45 minutes of abstract conversation becomes tangible validation*

## 1. Context (the setup)

The room buzzed with energy. Twenty-five people around three tables, each group deep in 45-minute conversations about their 5-year vision for social mapping, transfer conversations, or exploratory dialogue. Rich discussions, lots of ideas, but also that familiar facilitator feeling: *How do we capture this? How do we know we're on the same page?*

Long vision discussions are powerful but slippery. People get excited, build on each other's ideas, but by the end you're left wondering: what did we actually decide? What's our shared picture of where we're heading? The old approach meant lots of flipchart notes and hoping everyone heard the same thing.

## 2. The try (the prompt itself)

After 45-60 minutes of vision discussion, the facilitator pulled out her phone—which had been quietly capturing the entire conversation through Dembrane—and launched the "visie terugkoppeling" prompt.

The AI processed the transcript and generated a structured vision document, written in the same formal, collaborative tone as the approved transformation plan. Not a summary of what was said, but a coherent vision statement ready for group validation.

## 3. What happened (the raw result)

Within 30 seconds, a document appeared on the beamer. Not bullet points or rough notes, but a polished vision statement:

*"Identified Theme: Exploratory Dialogue*

*Concept Vision Exploratory Dialogue (for validation):*

*By 2029, the Exploratory Dialogue has evolved into a low-threshold, integrated access to support for all residents in our region. The traditional focus on mental health has broadened to a holistic perspective on health, where the dialogue is accessible through various routes and is conducted by a joint team from all involved organizations.*

*Crucial Vision Components:*
*• Joint ownership through new organizational entity in which all partners are represented*
*• Low-threshold accessibility via multiple routes (family doctor, social domain)*
*• Learning organization with duo-teams that share expertise*
*• Adequate infrastructure for effective collaboration and feedback*"

The room fell quiet. Then: "Yes, that captures exactly what we meant." "That's our vision, but better organized than how we said it." The facilitator asked: "Does this reflect your discussion?" Nods around the table.

## 4. The why (your reflection)

AI turned abstract conversation into concrete text that the group could validate. The facilitator stayed present with the group dynamics, reading faces and managing energy. Meanwhile, AI caught the content patterns and structured them into something tangible.

What struck me was the validation moment. These weren't AI-generated ideas imposed on the group—it was their own thinking reflected back in organized form. They recognized their thoughts, but clearer. The professional terminology was there (IZA, GALA, POH-GGZ), but so was the collaborative spirit of "samen" and "gezamenlijk."

The magic was in making the abstract concrete. Long discussions need validation points. Instead of "Did everyone get that?" it became "Does this document capture what you meant?"

## 5. The takeaway (for others)

Use this when groups have rich discussions but need to validate shared understanding. Perfect for vision sessions, strategy conversations, or any time abstract ideas need to become concrete agreements.

The timing matters—let the conversation reach its natural peak, then use AI to structure what was discussed. The group validates and adjusts. From flowing conversation to shared document in minutes.

It's not about replacing facilitator skills. It's about giving facilitators a tool to make abstract conversations tangible, when they feel the group is ready for that validation moment.

*This pattern works for any collaborative visioning session where you need to move from discussion to documented agreement. The key is human timing plus AI structuring.*
