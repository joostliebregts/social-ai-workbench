# The first experiment

This session is the first session where I tested whether AI could actually help during live transformation planning sessions, not just afterward. Three prompts, one facilitator's phone on the table, and a Google Doc projected on the beamer.

## What happened here

We were co-creating what is called a 'transformation plan' for improving a mental health network across a Dutch region. Hour-long conversations about 5-year visions, intake-conversations, involving citizens, etc.. with groups rotating between tables. Instead of just taking notes, we used AI to catch patterns in real-time and create bridges between groups.

Three prompts ran in sequence during the session:

**1. Tussentijdse visie terugkoppeling** — After 45-60 minutes of vision discussion, this prompt grabbed the transcript and turned it into a structured vision document. Back to the group for validation: "Does this capture what you meant?"

**2. Vraag voor volgende groep** — The "echo button." Analyzed what just happened, connected it to earlier conversations, and generated 1-2 connecting questions for the next group. Bridge-building in 10 seconds.

**3. Synthese per thema** — End-of-day synthesis. All conversations about one theme (Social Map, Transfer Table, or Exploratory Conversation) turned into a coherent concept document. Not used live—this one was for the final transformation plan.

## The setup that worked

Simple: Facilitator's phone on the table with Dembrane running. Session done? Copied Dembrane's output to Google Doc projected so everyone could see the AI output. Most importantly—sticky notes stayed essential for visualization and co-creation. AI worked parallel to the existing process, not instead of it.

The facilitator stayed fully present with the group—reading faces, holding emotions, guiding process. The co-facilitator handled the tech: monitoring transcripts, launching prompts, managing iterations.

## What we learned

Later versions focused more on using participants' actual language rather than translating everything into professional jargon. The AI caught patterns while humans held space. Timing mattered more than sophistication—a good intervention at the right moment beat a perfect analysis that came too late.

The transparency was key. Everyone could see what the AI was doing, how it was processing their words, and what it was generating. That created trust rather than distance.

This was version 0.1—messy, provisional, but it worked. People stayed engaged. The synthesis actually captured what they meant. And we learned that AI doesn't replace facilitation; it strengthens it by catching what facilitators might miss while they're staying present with the group.
