# The Echo Button

*A 10-second bridge between rotating groups*

## 1. Context (the setup)

We were in the middle of a transformation planning session with 25 people. Three groups rotated between tables, each discussing vision, social mapping, or exploratory conversations. After 45 minutes of intense dialogue, the facilitator felt it: *now we need to capture the essence for the next group.*

The old way would have been taking notes, maybe summarizing on a flipchart, hoping the next group picks up where this one left off. Usually some connection is lost, momentum breaks.

## 2. The try (the prompt itself)

The facilitator opened Dembrane on her phone and pressed the "echo button"—a prompt I had prepared to catch the core of the conversation and generate a bridge question for the next group.

No fancy setup needed. Just her phone lying on the table, already capturing the transcript, and one button press when she felt the moment was right.

## 3. What happened (the raw result)

10 seconds. That's all it took. A question appeared on the screen—not for this group, but for the next group coming to this table:

*"Group 1 discussed the vision for exploratory conversations and highlighted three key challenges with current intake processes. What would be the most important next step to address these challenges while keeping the focus on genuine dialogue with citizens?"*

The current group went quiet, then someone said, "Yes, that's exactly what we were struggling with." Another person: "That's a perfect way to start the next conversation." They could see their entire discussion crystallized into one sharp starting point for the next group.

## 4. The why (your reflection)

AI caught what that specific group had just discussed and crystallized it into a bridge question for the next group. The facilitator stayed present with the current group, AI did the pattern matching. No day of work with sticky notes, just 10 seconds to create continuity between rotating groups.

What struck me was the dual impact. The current group felt heard—their discussion was captured perfectly. And the next group would get a meaningful starting point instead of walking into a blank conversation. The facilitator chose when to press that button, timing it for maximum connection between groups.

The magic wasn't in the AI—it was in AI being used to create bridges between groups at exactly the right moment.

## 5. The takeaway (for others)

Use this when groups are rotating and you want them to build on each other's work. Timing is everything—the facilitator feels when the moment is right.

It's not about replacing facilitation skills. It's about augmenting them. The facilitator's sense of when to intervene, when to let conversation flow, when to capture and bridge—that stays human. AI just makes the bridging faster and sharper.

*This pattern works in any collaborative context where you have rotating discussions: strategy sessions, design workshops, community planning, team retrospectives. The key is transparent use at the right moment.*
