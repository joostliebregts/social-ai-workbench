# From valuable session input to structured concept document in 1 minute

*How AI amplifies the thoughtful work of facilitators*

## The story behind this prompt

**Where she was**: The project leader stands at the end of an intensive day with 20-30 people from [REGION]. Each table has carefully worked on different components of their 5-year vision: what does the exploratory conversation look like? How do they organize the consultation table? What role does the social map play? The tables show the results of their work: carefully placed sticky notes, worksheets full of valuable insights, and that familiar energy of "we've gathered lots of good stuff, how do we bring this together?"

**The usual problem**: Normally, she takes all the sticky notes home. Then follows a full day of puzzling: organizing all input by theme, writing a coherent story, creating a concept document. Then to the 10-person writing team: "What do you think of this?" Integrate feedback. Only then is there something that resembles a transformation plan.

**The attempt**: "What if AI made this concept document directly?" I suggested. The project leader: "I'd like to try that."

**What the AI did**: All conversations from the day—every table round, every rotation, every discussion about citizen participation and professional collaboration—were processed through one prompt. The system analyzed the writing style of previously approved transformation plans from this region. 1 minute later: a coherent concept sub-plan that felt as if it had been made by the writing team itself.

**The breakthrough**: From valuable session insights to structured concept document without losing human expertise. The structure was there, the terminology was correct (IZA, GALA, MGN, POH-GGZ), the story held together. The document was ready to go directly to the writing team, not to undergo another day of editing.

## When to use this

This is your endgame prompt for transformation sessions. Use this **after the entire workshop** when you have:

- All transcripts from the complete day
- Need a coherent story per theme (Social Map, Exploratory Conversation, Consultation Table)
- Must go from loose input to concept sub-plan ready for your writing team
- Want to maintain the writing style of previous plans

**Setup**: Phone + laptop + projector. The co-facilitator has access to all transcripts and runs this prompt per theme.

## Why this is useful

**Timing beats perfection**: Instead of a day puzzling at home, you have material within minutes that the writing team can work with.

**Human insights remain central**: The AI only synthesizes what people have discussed. No new ideas, no assumptions—just converting the chaos of a productive day into readable structure.

**Style consistency**: By analyzing how previous plans were written, the output feels familiar to everyone involved.

## For your context

Use this synthesis prompt when you've spent a day talking with multiple stakeholders about complex topics and need to make one coherent story from all input. It doesn't only work for transformation plans—any situation where you need to go from "much discussed" to "clear document."

---

**Practical tip**: Run this prompt per theme separately. You'll get multiple coherent sub-plans instead of one large document where everything runs together.
